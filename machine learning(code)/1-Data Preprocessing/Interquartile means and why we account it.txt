The term **interquartile** refers to the **range** between the **first quartile (Q1)** and the **third quartile (Q3)** of a dataset. It is a measure of **spread** and helps describe the **middle 50%** of the data.

### **Letâ€™s break it down:**

- **Q1 (First Quartile)**: This is the **25th percentile**, which means **25%** of the data points fall below it.
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: This is the **75th percentile**, which means **75%** of the data points fall below it.
  
So, the **interquartile range (IQR)** is simply the **difference** between the **third quartile (Q3)** and the **first quartile (Q1)**:

\[
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
\]

### **Why is Interquartile Range (IQR) Useful?**

- The **IQR** tells you how spread out the middle 50% of your data is. 
- Itâ€™s especially helpful because it is **less affected by extreme values (outliers)** compared to the **range** (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset).

### **Example:**
Letâ€™s take this dataset:
```
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]
```

1. **Step 1: Find the Quartiles**  
   - **Q1** (25th percentile): This is the median of the first half of the data: **3**.
   - **Q3** (75th percentile): This is the median of the second half of the data: **13**.

2. **Step 2: Calculate the IQR**
   - **IQR** = **Q3 - Q1** = **13 - 3** = **10**.

So, the **interquartile range (IQR)** for this dataset is **10**.

### **Summary:**

- **Interquartile** simply means **the range between the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3)**.
- **IQR** is a measure of the **middle 50%** of your data.
- Itâ€™s useful because it **ignores outliers**, focusing only on the central data values.
