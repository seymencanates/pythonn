Programming language should have a beginning,processes and an end

All thing have a algorithm

Algorithm of going school


how to use algorithm?

Algorithm provides to coding in ANY language





examples of algorithms


brush your teeth before sleep

go to school if time has come


example1:

algorithm with only text

1-beginning

2-enter, two number(number1,number2);

3-multiply , (c=number1*number2)

4-print, result of multiply(c)

5-Stop


pseudo-code version of algorithm:

1-beginning

2-input(number1,number2)

3-multiply=number1*number2

4-print(multiply)

5-Stop

flow charts

math version of algorithm:

1-begin 

2-A,b

3-C=A*b

4-C 

5-Stop 

another algorithm(how to account area of square)

1- begin 

2- a 

3- alan = a*a 

4-alan 

5-end
