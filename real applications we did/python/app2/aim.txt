Our aim is to prepare a date saver app into the file. The program can save the real date including;

exact second,
exact minute,
exact hour,
exact day,
exact month,
exact year

The parameters is going to save into the dict object which we can easily convert into the json or else which
we can save into the database

When the use click button (we will use tkinter for this) the program will save the date into the dict object.

Question 1 : Where we can use these type of code in real life as an asset?





Question 2 : How can we improve this code?Which features we can add?
